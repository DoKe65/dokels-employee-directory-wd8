# Teamtreehouse Webdevelopement Techdegree - Unit 8
## Connect to and Use a Public API
*By DoKe65 (Doris Keller)*  

In this 8th project of Teamtreehouses Web Development Techdegree we're asked to create an employees dirctory for a fictive startup, using sample data from the Random User Generator API https://randomuser.me. 

The directory should include a list of 12 employees. Everytime the page is refreshed, 12 new random users should be displayed, including a photo, name, email address and the city. 

The search function searches for matching names (full names) and removes the employees not matching the input from the directory. 

When a user clicks on one of the cards, an overlay has to be displayed with detailled informations, a way to close the window and a possibility to switch forth and back between the currently displayed employees. Thus, if a search was previously executed, a user can only switch back and forth between employees matching the search result.

Other than a mockup for how the page should look roundabout, nothing is provided and we need to write the necessary files from scratch.

### Provided Files
- mockup of the directory in desktop view
- mockup of the overlay

### Skills used
- html
- css
- javascript

**Be happy and code on!**
