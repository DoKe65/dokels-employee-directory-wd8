# Teamtreehouse Webdevelopement Techdegree - Unit 8
## Connect to and Use a Public API
*By DoKe65 (Doris Keller)*  

In this 8th project of Teamtreehouses Web Development Techdegree we're asked to create an employees dirctory for a fictive startup, using sample data from the Random User Generator API https://randomuser.me. 

The directory should include a list of 12 employees. Everytime the page is refreshed, 12 new random users should be displayed, including a photo, name, email address and the city. 

When a user clicks on one of the cards, an overlay has to be displayed with detailled informations, a way to close the window and a possibility to switch forth and back between each employee.

Searching for a user does two things: It searches for matching user names (full names) and hides the employees not matching the input. When displaying an employee's detailed information inside the overlay, switching back and forth only shows the employees currently displayed inside the directory (search results).

Other than a mockup for how the page should look roundabout, nothing is provided and we need to write the necessary files from scratch.

### Provided Files
- mockup of the directory in desktop view
- mockup of the overlay

### Skills used
- html
- css
- javascript

**Be happy and code on!**
